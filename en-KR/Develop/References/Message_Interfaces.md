# Message interface

CIC messages are defined and categorized into interfaces by their purpose and usage and each interface is defined in a namespace. Use these interfaces to create event messages to send to CIC or to interpret directive messages returned from CIC.

The available namespaces are shown below. Click each link to find out more about a namespace.
